# Car Sales Portal (CSP) Mobile
This frontend mobile application was written for CSP Inc, a South African organization which runs a platform to manage and consolidate second-hand car dealerships and listings across the country.

The Flutter application leverages pre-existing REST API's to communicate with a PHP server, and stands alongside a pre-existing web interface as a mobile-specific version.
Through this mobile app, car dealers can access the CSP car listings database, view listings belonging to each of their dealerships (including data and images of each car), and create and upload new listings to the database. 
The CSP system then proliferates these changes across all 3rd-party sites on the internet where these listings are shown.

This mobile implementation of the CSP portal uses modern Google-inspired Material Design and secure REST communication over the internet. As a Flutter application, CSP Mobile is compatible with Android and iOS.
